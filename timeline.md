#### 04 - 05
11:41pm to 7:15am (before alarm)

#### 05
Napped for half an hour.

#### 14
> Last night sleep was ok, had a bit more blood than usual, is it because of the pillow? Need to do some experiment

#### 15
Woke up at 8am

Woke up at 6:30am

#### 25
Sick? Mentioned "not fully recovered", "have meds and then slept until after 1pm"

#### 6
> Napping at work continued to work great, although I had to find a new spot.

#### 8
Continued to wake up at 6am.
Nap quality is alright, didn't feel as refreshed after waking up. Almost oversleep.
Struggling to stay mentally normal the whole afternoon.
Hence, played some Quantum Break, Sleeping Dogs, and XCOM.

#### 9
Had a good sleep last night, fell asleep quickly and woke up quite refreshed.
Altho I wasn't fully asleep during the afternoon nap, I felt fine and didn't
fall asleep during town hall.
It's lasting well to right now which is 10:20pm and I still haven't felt severe
drowsiness.
I'm liking this biphasic schedule. But let's see how it goes for the rest of the
week.

#### 10
Morning routine's good, keep it up. Night sleep was not bad.
- Nap - thinking that even I don't actually sleep, just closing my eyes and have
some rest is good.

#### 11
Morning routine still going well. (I assume getting up early at 6am)

Plus

- Night sleep
- Nap was also good.

#### 12
> Clinic diagnose went way quicker than I expected.
> She just asked me some questions. But she's going to arrange a more professional exam later.

This is probably for my nosebleed?

#### 14
Got up early (6am I assume).

> went to clinic to check pee. Went to do blood test after going home.

(Worried about diabetes because of symptoms? Frequent urination, blurred vision?)

This is when I bought the mold producing bath tub plug according to Amazon.

#### 15
Sleep wasn't so great.
Bladder urine test.

> Set up Air Purifier

Had smell from heating vent.

#### 18
> Today is the first day I'm not taking any caffeine.
> Nap quality was okay, maybe the other location is better.
> Had a bit of a crash at 8:30pm. Feeling a bit better now.
> Ok, feeling really sleepy at around 10:30pm. Not doing anything particularly useful right now.
