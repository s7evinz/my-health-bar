# Why I don't think it's psychological
As I'm typing this, I'm literally dizzy, nauteus, vision blurry and it feels like a struggle.

## I had severe insomnia before induced by anxiety and physical pain
At the beginning of 2019, I started coughing really bad. I could only get 1 hour of sleep for almost a week. It was because I coughed especially bad at night and lying down. Looking up the symptoms, I thought I mihgt have HIV. And I worried that since I'm not sleeping, it'd only get worse. This is why it was caused by both anxiety and physical pain. 

However, I don't recall having this weird head feeling that I'm having right now. The sleep deprivation effect or headache was more distinct. Now it's more muddy masked by this weird headache or discomfort. Once I elminated the possibility of HIV, I was much more relaxed and was able to take a deep nap. Nowadays, I feel like that falling asleep natural mechanism is broken. It could be blocked by this weird headache, or the mechanism is actually broken.

## Another example of anxiety-induced episode
When I was sleeping in a basement room in late 2015, there was bug crawling and it prevented me from sleeping. But eventually my tiredness overcame my anxiety.

## I was able to game until 3am and then fall asleep
Even in Dec 2017, I was gaming until 3am in front of a 55 inch TV. It'd took me a while to fall asleep because of the excitement, but once the sleepiness kicks in, it's not resistable. It's natural.

Nowadays, I dim the light, make my screen color warm, among various sleep hygiene, nothing's really helping.

## I used to have irresistable sleep drive after lunch
Even if I had more than 7 hours of sleep.

It's not happening anymore even if I had little to no sleep.

## It's worsened over the course this year
Especially during late summer. Stress (job interview) might have taken it to the next level but even before then, my sleep felt shallow, often with frequent awakenings, and doesn't feel restorative.
