# List of Symptoms
I currently have.

- Insomnia
  - One of the weirdest things about my insomnia is the **absence of the sleepiness** feeling, the ability to **nod off** or doze off. The sleepiness only sort of comes back after days of very poor sleep, and it's not like how it used to feel when I was trying to stay up to reset for jet lag.
    - Through out most of my study and working life in Canada, I always yawn and struggle to not nod off after lunch time. This is probably due to my habit of taking a nap in the afternoon in China before the age of 17. However, ever since my insomnia, I might still yawn for 10 to 15 minutes, I no longer nod off in the afternoon. 
    - Sometimes I barely feel sleepiness at bed time but I am still able to fall asleep. But I wake up frequently afterwards.
    - Sometime in early October, it was the last time I was able to fall asleep to an Audiobook (Audible purchased on Sep 27). I was listening to it until I lost track of the content and I was able to fall asleep. I tried to reproduce the same the next day and I was not nodding off even when it was 3 or 4am. I went to bed anyways.
  - If I do fall asleep, I wake up every hour, and then after certain hour, say 7am, I can't fall back to sleep again, even if I feel like sleeping more.
  - Sometimes even when I'm tired and without racing thoughts I still can't sleep or sleep very little. Only after realizing that fact I become anxious.
    - Oct 20, moved stuff from old house to new house, exhausted. Went to bed early at 11:15, slept for maybe an hour? I'm not sure. And was awake the rest of the night.
    - Oct 13, after two nights of little sleep of poor quality, was unable to sleep for the whole night albeit extremely tired and sleepy. Might have something to do with the noisy hotel room but I expected that I'd pass out due to the extreme exhaustion.
- Nose / Sinus problems
  - Nosebleed. This one's been happening for at least 1 to 2 years or more?
    - Last time or the first time I saw an ENT was on Apr 30, 2018. He found nothing and suggested most likely due to dryness of environment.
  - Blood in general in my nose depending on the day. Some day my mucus is clear, other days there's blood, or bloody.
  - Nasal congestion is relatively new (not due to cold). I believe it's developed since sometime around mid 2019?
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Blurred vision
- Back pain
  - My shoulder, my middle back, my lower back
  - Feels muscular in nature    
- Random needle pain
  - Happens around my body, I'll try to record more info.
- Bruises
  - Two unexplained yellow bruises found on my left thigh.
- Left hand weakness
  - This has happened before
