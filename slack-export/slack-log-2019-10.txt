Last night sleep

11:45-2:48
And then woke up every hour
Until 7
After that still sleepy but didn’t fall asleep
Had a short dream or hallucination at around 8:30
Got up after 9
Shit took 20 min
Plentiful
Visited family doc
She said it’s psychological
Will refer me to a psychiatrist
I don’t believe it
She also told me to keep taking trazadone
Currently I have back pain , feels more like the muscle soreness kind
Slept for maybe 6 hours in total but I don’t feel refreshed but seemingly better than yesterday so far
Yesterday I slept two 1 hours and then one 2 hours from 3:44 to 6:23am

Oct 15 had my first hallucination - saw a bug crawl on my right hand
s7evinz:tangerine: 3:53 PM
When I tried to understand a programming question, I felt a strange feeling in my head that kinda prevents understanding
This triggered a bit of anxiety in me - I’m not sure if that strange mental blocking feeling is due to lack of sleep or something else
With this, I can say I can feel my anxiety
I know when I’m relaxed
Because when I’m anxious, say before an interview, before social situations, I have the so called stress-induced irritable bowel syndrome
I would trigger the urge to empty my shits
This is also what happened at the beginning of my insomnia
On Aug 24 or the subsequent total insomnia
I was constantly going to the bathroom
Which has not been happening. What I’m trying to say is I know when I’m anxious.
s7evinz:tangerine: 4:23 PM
Feeling brain fog headache and a little bit of nausea
s7evinz:tangerine: 6:31 PM
The kind of headache I have is unsettling.
s7evinz:tangerine: 6:42 PM
I wouldn’t even call it headaches because it’s not painful but it’s like my brain is not having enough oxygen it’s just not having energy and making it difficult to think
It’s like I’m blocked from accessing higher intelligence such as implementing a programming solution.

Reasoning
Blocked from reasoning and recalling
Makes me Dizzy, and physically weak
Sluggishness
s7evinz:tangerine: 8:12 PM
Weird head feeling has subsided a bit so is nausea
Easier to talk with ppl too
I’m also home at this point
